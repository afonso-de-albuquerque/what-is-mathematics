### 1. Introduction. 引言

> (Page 60) *Exercise:* 1\) Prove that $\sqrt[3]2, \sqrt3, \sqrt5, \sqrt[3]3$ are not rational. (Hint: Use the lemma of p. 47).

> 2\) Prove that $\sqrt2 + \sqrt3$ and $\sqrt2 + \sqrt[3]2$ are not rational. (Hint: if e.g. the first of these numbers were equal to a rational number $r$ then, writing $\sqrt3 = r - \sqrt2$ and squaring, $\sqrt2$ would be rational.)

> 3\) Prove that $\sqrt2 + \sqrt3 + \sqrt5$ is irrational. Try to make up similar and more general examples.

### 2. Decimal Fractions. Infinite Decimals. 十进位小数 无穷小数

> (Page 63) *Exercise:* Calculate $\sqrt[3]2$ and $\sqrt[3]5$ with an accuracy of at least $10^{-2}$.

### 3. Limits. Infinite Geometrical Series. 极限 无穷等比级数

> (Page 66) *Exercise:* 1\) Prove that $1 - q + q^2 - q^3 + \dots = \frac{1}{1 + q}$, if $|q| < 1$.

> 2\) What is the limit of the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots$, where $a_n = n/(n+1)$? (Hint: Write the expression in the form $n/(n+1) = 1 - 1/(n+1)$ and observe that the second term tends to zero).

> 3\) What is the limit of $\frac{n^2+n+1}{n^2-n+1}$ for $n \to \infty$? (Hint: Write the expression in the form
>
> $$
> \frac{1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n^2}}{1-\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n^2}}.)
> $$

> 4\) Prove, for $|q| < 1$, that $1 + 2q + 3q^2 + 4q^3 + \dots = \frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$. (Hint: Use the result of exercise 3 on p.18.)

> 5\) What is the limit of the infinite series
>
> $$
> 1 - 2q + 3q^2 - 4q^3 + \dots \quad?
> $$

> 6\) What is the limit of $\frac{1+2+3+\dots+n}{n^2}$, of $\frac{1^2+2^2+3^2+\dots+n^2}{n^3}$, and of $\frac{1^3+2^3+3^3+\dots+n^3}{n^4}$? (Hint: Use the results of pp. 12, 14, 15.)

### 4. Rational Numbers and Periodic Decimals. 有理数和循环小数

> (Page 67~68) *Exercise:* 1\) Expand the fractions $\frac{1}{1}$, $\frac{1}{13}$, $\frac{2}{13}$, $\frac{3}{13}$, $\frac{1}{17}$, $\frac{2}{17}$ into decimal fractions and determine the period.

> *2\) The number $142,857$ has the property that multiplication with any one of the numbers $2, 3, 4, 5,$ or $6$ produces only a cyclic permutation of its digits. Explain this property, using the expansion of $\frac{1}{7}$ into a decimal fraction.

> 3\) Expand the rational numbers of exercise 1 as "decimals" with bases $5, 7,$ and $12$.

> 4\) Expand one-third as a dyadic number.

> 5\) Write $.11212121\dots$ as a fraction. Find the value of this symbol if it is meant in the systems with the bases $3$ or $5$.

> 2\) Show that the set $S + T$ (see p. 110) is denumerable if $S$ and $T$ are denumerable sets. Show the same for the sum of three, four, or any number, $n$, of sets, and finally for a set composed of denumerably many denumerable sets.

> (Page 82) *Exercose:* Show that any interval $[A, B]$ of the number axis is equivalent to any other interval $[C, D]$.

> (Page 83) *Exercise:* Prove that the same result holds for a denumerable set of points in the plane, replacing lengths of intervals by areas of squares.

### 3. Cantor’s “Cardinal Numbers”. 康托的“基数”

> (Page 85) *Exercise:* If $A$ contains $n$ elements, where $n$ is a positive integer, show that $B$, defined as above, contains $2^n$ elements. If $A$ consists of the set of all positive integers, show that $B$ is equivalent to the continuum of real numbers from $0$ to $1$. (Hint: Symbolize a subset of $A$ in the first case by a finite and in the second case by an infinite sequence of the symbols $0$ and $1$,

> 4\) Calculate $\sqrt{5+12i}$. (Hint: Write $\sqrt{5+12i} = x + yi$, square, and equate real and imaginary parts.)
